        ### Summary of our main tasks done to use Streamlit /GitHub

            - we prepared the data set to gain some memory
            - we select the road accident from 2012-2015
            - we kept road accident 2016 seperately to compare with our prediction
            - we did run the classification non-linear models: GBC - RFC - KNN - SVC - (XGBOOST?)
            - EDA and Dataviz are using road accidents from 2012 to 2016
